# Noir

A comprehensive post-processing solution designed to give your projects a classic, stylized film noir aesthetic. It combines several configurable visual elements to achieve a range of looks, from subtle desaturation and mood lighting to more pronounced vintage film appearances.

## How To Use

1.  Ensure your project is using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
2.  Select your URP Asset in the Project window (usually found under `Settings`).
3.  In the Inspector for the URP Asset, find the "Renderer Features" list.
4.  Click the "Add Renderer Feature" button.
5.  Select "Noir" from the list of available features.
6.  Configure the effect settings directly in the Inspector of the added "Noir" feature.
